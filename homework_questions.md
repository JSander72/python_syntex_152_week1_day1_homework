1. Showcase Your Dance Moves!
Python Indentation Practice with if Statements

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to understand the importance of indentation in Python, especially with if statements.

Task 1: Code Correction Below is a piece of Python code with incorrect indentation. Your task is to correct it.

weather = "sunny"

if weather == "sunny":
print("Wear sunglasses!")
else:
print("Take an umbrella!")
Task 2: Your Mood Today  Create another if statement evaluating the users mood. Ask the user how they feel today using input(). If they say "happy", print "That's great to hear!", and if they say "sad", print "I hope your day gets better!". Ensure your if statement is properly indented.

By the end of this assignment, you should feel more confident about how if statements work in Python and how to indent them properly.
2. Python Data Types and type() Function!
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

Task 1: Code Correction Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable using type() and then use the print() function to print it out:

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True
3. Arithmetic Operations in Daily Life
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.
